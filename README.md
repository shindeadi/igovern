# igovern
A platform for collaborative governance

IGovern is a universal communication platform between government and the citizens
The government doesnâ€™t have any medium to know what does the public thinks about the reforms that they are planning to bring.
Indian citizens need a system to raise their issues or present their demands in front of the government.
To get the benefit of government schemes citizens have to create accounts on the website of that scheme. They need to authenticate themselves and upload documents. If someone wants to take benefit of multiple schemes then that person has to perform this repetitive task multiple times. A centralized platform is needed where citizens can create accounts and use the same account for applying on every scheme they want.

### How it works?
1) First of all the user will need to register on the portal. 
2) We have to types of users: Government employees and normal indian citizens.

5) A unique identification token should be entered for posting the reform.
6) When the user posts the reform then it will be stored in the database and will be visible to everyone in the
reform section

7) No as this reform is visible to every user on the platform they are able to give their opinion about this reform.
8) If users want to support the reform they can click on Upvote button and if they want to oppose then they will click
on Downvote button.
9) Later the government officials will be able to see no of upvotes, downvotes and which users upvoted and downvoted.
10) So hence the goverment officials will be to know overall opinion of all the citizens about the reform which will help them
to take an informed decision.
